on the `Add task` button or the `Quick Add Task` in the navigation bar. The task is created by filling 
the input fields in the modal that appears. On first visit, users' tasks are saved to a default project. 
Users can however create new projects from the sidebar. The modal provides options to assign tasks to a project. 
All tasks and projects are stored in Local Storage.
